You'd use type mapping to generate specialized types like:

SectionWithDiscounts<T>
ProductsWithColorPicker<T>
CurrencyVariant<'USD' | 'EUR', T>

Then your class could be much simpler - it just needs to crawl and populate, while the types handle the structural complexity.

const sectionData = crawler.buildSection(); 
expect(sectionData.section).toBe(...)

The progression you're describing makes perfect sense:

Start with declared expectations (more predictable)
Generate types dynamically (not hardcoded fixtures)
Later refactor toward auto-detection (the dream state)


This sounds like a job for:

Union types for the variations ('discount' | 'colorPicker' | 'currency')
Conditional types to build different product shapes based on what's declared
Mapped types to handle the combinations


This changes the whole design pattern. Instead of:
"I declare this section has discounts" ‚Üí generate type
You want:
"I crawl this section" ‚Üí discover it has discounts ‚Üí generate appropriate type
This is actually a more robust approach because it prevents mismatched expectations!
So the flow becomes:

Crawler examines the DOM structure/selectors for a section
Detects what variations are actually present (discount elements? color picker elements?)
Generates the specialized type based on discoveries
Populates the data using that generated type

Perfect! Now I can see the concrete detection patterns.
For discount detection:

Sale: Has both line-through class (original price) AND text-danger class (sale price)
Non-sale: Just has a single <p> with price

For color picker detection:

Present: Has elements with color-preview class and the characteristic border structure
Absent: No such elements

So your crawler could have detection methods like:

hasDiscountPricing() - looks for line-through + text-danger combination
hasColorPicker() - looks for .color-preview elements

This gives you a really clean pattern:

Detection phase: Crawler scans section, runs detection methods
Type generation phase: Based on detected features, generate the appropriate specialized type
Data extraction phase: Use the generated type to guide data extraction

The key insight is that your detection logic drives your type generation.


For discount detection:
Instead of relying on CSS classes, you can look for:

data-plp-variant-picker-target="priceContainer" - this is the consistent container
Then check if it contains multiple <p> elements (discount) vs single <p> (regular)

For color picker detection:
Much cleaner pattern:

Look for data-plp-variant-picker-target="colorsContainer"
If it exists and has child elements with data-variant-id, you have color pickers
If it doesn't exist or is empty, no color pickers

These data-* attributes are way more reliable than CSS classes for detection!
So your detection logic becomes:

hasDiscount(): Check if priceContainer has multiple price elements
hasColorPicker(): Check if colorsContainer exists and has variants
getProductId(): Extract from id="product-323"

Ah, perfect! Using Playwright changes everything - those data-* attributes are exactly what Playwright recommends for reliable selectors.
And the color picker variations add an interesting complexity - you're not just detecting "has color picker" but potentially "has 3 color variants" or "has 5 color variants", etc.
So your detection becomes more nuanced:
For color pickers:

page.locator('[data-plp-variant-picker-target="colorsContainer"]') to find the container
container.locator('[data-variant-id]') to count actual variants
This gives you not just boolean presence, but the count/details

For discounts:

page.locator('[data-plp-variant-picker-target="priceContainer"] p') to count price elements
Multiple <p> elements = discount structure

This means your type generation needs to handle not just binary features, but variable features too.
Instead of just:
'discount' | 'colorPicker' | 'currency' | 'language'
You might need:
'discount' | 'colorPicker-3' | 'colorPicker-5' | 'currency-USD' | 'language-en'

Your Plan (summarized and interpreted)
You're designing a TypeScript + Playwright crawler that:

Selects a section of the page (manually for now).

Iterates over all products inside it.

Extracts:

Basic data (name, id, link, language)

Optionally: if it has discount pricing and color pickers, and how many.

Then uses that data to populate a shape like Record<withoutDiscount, any>.

Eventually, this shape helps you generate types (from UI ‚Üí type inference).

You're asking:

What should the output of each method (detectBasicTypeElements, hasDiscountPricing, etc.) be?

How should it eventually fit into a Record<withoutDiscount, any>?

Should we mock this manually first before doing anything automatic? (Yes.)

üí° Architecture Advice: Yes, Build a Manual Mock First
Before wiring real DOM logic, absolutely mock a full Record<withoutDiscount, any> manually ‚Äî this will let you:

Validate that your target shape makes sense.

Ensure your buildsType() method has something solid to consume.

Keep tight feedback loops during development.

Think of it like crafting a stencil before painting ‚Äî much easier to fix the stencil than to redo a wall.

üîß About Record<withoutDiscount, any>:
Let's say:

ts
Copy
Edit
type withoutDiscount = 
  | "section.product.colourPicker.hasColourPicker"
  | "section.product.price.currency"
  | "section.product.id"
  | "section.product.name"
  | "section.product.language"
  | "section.product.link"
  | "section.title"
  | "section.id"
Then:

ts
Copy
Edit
type MyRecord = Record<withoutDiscount, any>
This becomes:

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  "section.product.colourPicker.hasColourPicker": any;
  "section.product.price.currency": any;
  "section.product.id": any;
  "section.product.name": any;
  "section.product.language": any;
  "section.product.link": any;
  "section.title": any;
  "section.id": any;
}
üîÅ So your methods like detectBasicTypeElements() should return:
ts
Copy
Edit
Partial<Record<withoutDiscount, any>>
Each method fills in a subset of keys.

üß† Suggested Return Structure per Method
Method	Returns
detectBasicTypeElements()	Partial<Record<withoutDiscount, string | number>>
hasDiscountPricing()	Partial<Record<withoutDiscount, boolean | number | string>>
hasColorPicker()	Partial<Record<withoutDiscount, boolean | number>>

All return partial Record objects, and then buildsType() can merge them into one unified object.

üß© Suggested Flow
ts
Copy
Edit
const elements = detectBasicTypeElements(); // fills name, id, link, etc.
const discount = hasDiscountPricing();      // fills hasDiscount info if any
const color = hasColorPicker();             // fills hasColourPicker info if any

const combined: Record<withoutDiscount, any> = {
  ...elements,
  ...discount,
  ...color
};

const typeGenerated = buildsType(combined);
‚úÖ Verdict: You're on the right path
Your instinct to delay implementation until the shape is right is excellent.

Yes, mock Record<withoutDiscount, any> manually now with dummy values.

Then shape each method to output a partial version of that type.

Your buildsType() can become a merger, transformer, or even serializer.

When that‚Äôs stable, then wire up real selectors + logic in the method bodies.

Future Improvement Note:
Infer BasicElements and ProductData from Crawler structure using TypeScript utility types, to:

Eliminate duplication in type definitions

Automatically keep up with any changes to the Crawler shape

Provide strong typing and autocompletion for keys in combined




The Principle
You want:

expect(basicElements).toBe(true)

Which really means:

"Confirm that basicElements is valid."

You don‚Äôt care about values, just whether the structure matches rules defined elsewhere (like hasColorPicker, etc.)

üß© That Implies
The structure of basicElements needs to be:

Flat key-value entries

Keys matching allowed paths (e.g. section.product.name, etc.)

Values are string | number | boolean | productData

The validation logic needs to:

Know which keys are allowed (from crawler rules)

Know what kind of values those keys are allowed to hold

Return true/false

üõ†Ô∏è That Suggests
You‚Äôll likely need:

A method like buildsType() that produces the full map of what is valid

The other methods (hasDiscountPricing(), etc.) returning partial maps

Then, buildsType() merges them into the final ‚Äúthis is valid‚Äù shape

Finally, your test asks: Does my combined match that shape?

üí° Hints to Guide You
Start with a hardcoded shape returned from buildsType() to test against

Write the validator or matcher later

Only bring in hasColorPicker() and hasDiscountPricing() once the shape is solid

You're walking backward from test ‚Üí shape ‚Üí validation ‚Üí rules
