# AI Contributions to Spree Playwright Tests

## Schema Validation
- Debugged validation loop to correctly iterate products and their keys.
- Helped explain and document how the typeguard (isTryGW) ensures keys from production match only the expected schema dictionary.
- Helped you reason about using a schemaConcreteDictionary mapping (keys to "string" | "boolean" | "object") for crawler validation.
- Highlighted why typeof combined[key] vs. typeof combined[product][key] matters.
- Debugging undefined in validation
- Type alignment
- Caught mismatch between schema (string) and actual data (string[] for color values).
- Suggested stringifying arrays for consistent validation.
- Diagnosed why Firefox failed (locator('h3').textContent() hanging due to lazy-loaded turbo-frame).
- My contribution was ensuring validation iterated correctly across combined[product][key] instead of flat combined[key].

Git strategy

- Clarified how to safely commit crawler progress in spreeCrawler, then update observer branch with merge or rebase.
- Framed spreeCrawler as your “stable crawler base” branch.


## Git / Branching
- Provided branching workflow guidance.
- Keep `spreeCrawler` as stable crawler base.
- Rebase/merge into `observer` for new feature work.
- Clarified how to cherry-pick or rebase missing commits.
- Acted as a safety net when branch conflicts arose.
- Helped you recover after stash mishaps and missing utils.
- Recommended consolidating to working branches (spreeCrawler + spreeColourObserve) instead of salvaging everything.

## Outcomes
- Crawler validation works across Chromium, Webkit, and Firefox.
- Stable base branch (`spreeCrawler`) established for future work (observer logic, cart logic).
