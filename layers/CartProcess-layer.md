File-by-File Breakdown
üß± ***collector.ts ‚Äî Raw Data Collector***

***Purpose:***
Acts as the entry point for data acquisition.
Fetches a list of available products by crawling the SpreeCommerce homepage.

Patterns Used:

Crawler / Data Provider

Retry Pattern (recursion when empty results)

Strengths:

Self-healing logic retries when no data is found.

Uses waitUntil: "domcontentloaded" for speed and stability.

Improvement Points:

Recursion lacks a maximum depth ‚Üí add an exit guard to prevent infinite loops.

Could store results to cache for faster re-runs.


üß± ***productFactory.ts ‚Äî Product Factory***

*** Purpose ***:
Builds a structured list of products, filters them based on properties (like sizeAvailable, quantityAvailable), and enriches with details from ProductPagePom.

Patterns Used:

Factory Method Pattern for product creation.

Template Method Pattern for filtering steps.

Strengths:

Clean decoupling between data collection and interaction logic.

Easily extensible ‚Äî add new factories for different test categories.

Risks / Notes:

Dependent on field naming conventions from collector.ts.

Potential performance overhead if product list is large (every product triggers a full navigation).


üß± ***productPagePom.ts ‚Äî Page Orchestrator***

***Purpose:***
Manages navigation across product pages, invoking lower-level ProductInnerView for interactions and capturing computed results.

Patterns Used:

Page Object Model (POM)

Aggregator Pattern

Strengths:

Decouples navigation from element-level actions.

Central orchestrator for composite operations.

Risks / Notes:

Random selection logic may cause nondeterministic CI runs (add a seed for reproducibility).

Error handling (timeouts, failed loads) could use retry encapsulation.


üß± ***productInnerView.ts ‚Äî Element Interaction Controller***

***Purpose:***
Encapsulates granular UI interactions (quantity, size, ‚Äúadd to cart‚Äù, verifying totals).

Patterns Used:

Atomic POM / Command Pattern hybrid ‚Äî exposes all actions dynamically through a getter (actions).

Strengths:

Self-contained interactions; every action is independent and mockable.

getEmptyResult() provides graceful fallback for missing elements.

Good use of locator scoping to avoid selector collisions.

Risks / Notes:

Fixed timeouts (waitForTimeout(1000‚Äì2000)) ‚Üí replace with conditional waits.

Cache behavior may cause async race conditions under parallel execution.


üß± ***productBuilder.ts ‚Äî Price Builder***

***Purpose***:
Provides a fluent interface for constructing a price context (base price, discount price).

Patterns Used:

Builder Pattern

Fluent API Design

Strengths:

Clean syntax: .hasBasicPrice(...).hasDiscountPrice(...).calculate()

Handles missing discounts gracefully (defaults to 0).

Risks / Notes:

Internal state not immutable ‚Äî could introduce side effects in parallel scenarios.

Return types could be expanded to PriceObject for clarity.


üß± ***productStrategy.ts ‚Äî Price Calculation Strategy***

***Purpose:***
Defines the algorithm for computing the final price per product.

Patterns Used:

Strategy Pattern

Strengths:

Cleanly separates pricing logic from UI or data handling.

Easy to extend for new calculation modes (e.g., tax-inclusive, bulk discount).

Risks / Notes:

Rounding logic may produce floating errors; consider using a precise arithmetic library (e.g. decimal.js).


üß± ***productComposite.ts ‚Äî Cart Manager + Composite Validator***

***Purpose***:
Aggregates all product-level calculations, sums them, and validates against the checkout total displayed in the UI.

Patterns Used:

Composite Pattern (CartManagement manages multiple ProductCompositeHolder objects)

Strategy Pattern (delegates pricing to CalculatePayment)

Template + Orchestrator Pattern (the Operation class drives the full scenario)

Strengths:

Very elegant structure ‚Äî clear separation of aggregation and execution.

Uses composition over inheritance, allowing test extension.

Validates both frontend and backend-calculated totals for accuracy.

Risks / Notes:

Uses regex string manipulation on totals ‚Äî may break with locale differences (e.g., commas for decimals).

Asynchronous mapping with Promise.all ‚Äî safe, but could introduce concurrency issues if DOM elements are mutated mid-loop.


üß± ***productCartManagement.spec.ts ‚Äî Spec Executor**

***Purpose:***
Top-level test driver. Launches the entire pipeline, clears context state, executes operation, and asserts final consistency.

Patterns Used:

End-to-End Orchestrator

Strengths:

One-line assertion (expect(financialResult).toBeTruthy()) abstracts a deeply complex flow.

Clean setup/teardown (context reset before execution).

High cohesion ‚Äî each run tests a real-world shopping flow, not just isolated functions.

Risks / Notes:

Single test structure limits reporting granularity (consider splitting into subtests per flow).

The 10-minute timeout (600000) may hide slowdowns; introduce performance metrics logging
