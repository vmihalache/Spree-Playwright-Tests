MainPagePom is a Page Object Model (POM) for the Spree Commerce main page.
It abstracts away raw Playwright selectors and provides structured access to:

Sections (frames on the homepage)

Products (inside each section)

Product attributes (title, price, colour options, etc.)

On top of that, it builds a structured object (objProducts) that matches the schema from your Crawler type ‚Äî so the scraper and the validator can work together.

üîπ Class Structure
Fields

Each readonly property is a locator ‚Äî a handle to a specific DOM element.
Examples:

sectionLocator ‚Üí all section <turbo-frame> containers.

colourPicker ‚Üí the container for product colour swatches.

regularPrice / discountPrice ‚Üí price elements inside each product card.

‚ö° This avoids hardcoding selectors everywhere. If the HTML changes, you update it once here.

Constructor
constructor(page: Page) {
    this.page = page
    this.sectionLocator = this.page.locator('turbo-frame[id^="section-"]')
    this.sectionTitle = this.page.locator('data-title')
    this.language = this.page.locator('button[data-action="modal#open"]').locator('span').last()
    this.currency = this.page.locator('button[data-action="modal#open"]').locator('span').first()
    ...
    this.sectionColour = {}
}


Takes a Page (Playwright browser tab).

Initializes all locators with CSS/XPath selectors that correspond to the site‚Äôs structure.

Initializes sectionColour as an empty object ‚Äî it‚Äôll later store swatch locators grouped by section.

openUrl()
async openUrl() {
    await this.page.goto("https://demo.spreecommerce.org/", { waitUntil: "domcontentloaded" });
}


Navigates to the homepage.

Uses domcontentloaded ‚Üí ensures base HTML is there (faster than waiting for full load).

getProductLocator()

This is the core scraper method.

What it does step by step:

Create an empty results object:

let objProducts = {}
this.sectionColour = {}


Get all homepage sections:

const listOfSections = await this.sectionLocator.all()


For each section (for m loop):

Scroll into view (ensures lazy-loaded products appear).

Collect all product cards inside it.

Extract the section ID (id="section-123").

Initialize sectionColour[sectionId] = [] for swatch storage.

For each product (for i loop inside section):

Wait until product title (h3) is visible (syncs with DOM).

Collect product attributes:

id (HTML id)

href (product detail link)

name (from <h3>)

section.title and section.id

Global values like language and currency.

Detect feature flags:

hasColourPicker ‚Üí is swatch container present?

hasDiscount ‚Üí is a ‚ÄúSale‚Äù tag present?

If colour picker exists:

Grab all swatch <data-color> attributes ‚Üí join them as comma-separated string.

If discount exists:

Extract discount price, otherwise set "no discount".

Push all swatch locators into sectionColour[sectionId].

Add structured product info into objProducts:

objProducts[sectionProductId] = {
    "section.product.id": ...,
    "section.product.name": ...,
    "section.product.link": ...,
    "section.product.language": ...,
    "section.product.colourPicker.hasColourPicker": ...,
    ...
}

Return Value

At the end:

return objProducts


You get a flat object mapping product IDs ‚Üí product data.

Keys match the dot-notation schema from tryGW.

This ensures CrawlerGenerate.validate() can run directly on it.

Getters
get getSectionLocator() {
    return this.sectionLocator
}
get getSectionColour() {
    return this.sectionColour
}


Convenience getters ‚Üí provide controlled access to locators and colour swatches.

For example, getSectionColour is used later by ColourImageObserver to track hover events.

üîπ Why This Is Good

Encapsulation ‚Üí all selectors live in one place.

Consistency ‚Üí outputs exactly match your validator schema.

Flexibility ‚Üí sectionColour is reusable both in crawler validation and in hover observer tests.

Robustness ‚Üí waits for visibility, scrolls sections into view, handles missing features gracefully.

‚úÖ In one sentence:
MainPagePom is the single source of truth for scraping the main page: it converts raw DOM into a structured schema-ready object (objProducts) and provides utilities like section-level swatch tracking, making it the backbone of both your crawler validation and your colour observer specs.
