# AI Contributions to Spree Playwright Tests

## Schema Validation
- Debugged validation loop to correctly iterate products and their keys.
- Helped explain and document how the typeguard (isTryGW) ensures keys from production match only the expected schema dictionary.
- Helped you reason about using a schemaConcreteDictionary mapping (keys to "string" | "boolean" | "object") for crawler validation.
- Highlighted why typeof combined[key] vs. typeof combined[product][key] matters.
- Debugging undefined in validation
- Type alignment
- Caught mismatch between schema (string) and actual data (string[] for color values).
- Suggested stringifying arrays for consistent validation.
- Diagnosed why Firefox failed (locator('h3').textContent() hanging due to lazy-loaded turbo-frame).
- My contribution was ensuring validation iterated correctly across combined[product][key] instead of flat combined[key].

## Cart Management 

| Interaction Focus | Outcome / Files Implemented | Core AI Contribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layered Structure Definition** | Technical Doc (`layers.md`) | Defined the six core layers (`Collector`, `Factory`, `Page Interaction`, `Business Logic`, `Composition`, `Spec`) and assigned responsibilities. |
| **Builder Pattern Implementation** | `productBuilder.ts` | Guided the creation of a Fluent API (Builder Pattern) for defining test product context (price, quantity, options) outside of the test spec. |
| **Orchestration/Validation** | `productComposite.ts` | Defined the Composite/Orchestrator pattern for aggregating multiple product calculations and validating the final cart total against calculated expectations. |
| **Interaction Decoupling** | `productInnerView.ts` | Guided the separation of granular UI element interactions into a dedicated Atomic POM layer. |

Git strategy

- Clarified how to safely commit crawler progress in spreeCrawler, then update observer branch with merge or rebase.
- Framed spreeCrawler as your “stable crawler base” branch.


## Git / Branching
- Provided branching workflow guidance.
- Keep `spreeCrawler` as stable crawler base.
- Rebase/merge into `observer` for new feature work.
- Clarified how to cherry-pick or rebase missing commits.
- Acted as a safety net when branch conflicts arose.
- Helped you recover after stash mishaps and missing utils.
- Recommended consolidating to working branches (spreeCrawler + spreeColourObserve) instead of salvaging everything.
  
In the CartProcess feature these were the git issue that AI agents tried helping to debug.
-| Problem Encountered | AI Diagnosis and Strategy | Commands Executed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **File Overwritten/Lost** | Identified the need for "Golden File Recovery" using the locally saved text file as the absolute source of truth to bypass corrupted Git history. | `git add <file>`, `git commit -m "fix(integration): Restored correct version..."` |

| **`nothing to commit` Error** | Diagnosed a corrupted Staging Index (`git diff --staged` was empty). Recommended isolating the change by stashing all unrelated files. | `rm filecheck.txt newOutput2.txt`, `git stash push -u -m "Temporary cleanup"`, `git checkout stash@{n} -- <file>` |

| **Branch Segmentation** | Guided the user to segment a single messy set of changes into clean, atomic branches for the Builder, Collector, and Configuration. | `git checkout -b <new-branch>`, `git add <specific files>` |

| **Final Merge Strategy** | Recommended the industry best practice of using a dedicated **Integration Branch** to test all features together before merging to `main`. | `git checkout -b integration/pdp-refactor`, `git merge --squash <feature-branch>`, `git push origin main` |

| **Workflow Justification** | Provided justification for the recovery strategy against potential feedback, emphasizing stability and time-to-solution over mandatory (but risky) `git reflog` dives. | Conceptual advice on professional Git best practices. |

## Outcomes
- Crawler validation works across Chromium, Webkit, and Firefox.
- Stable base branch (`spreeCrawler`) established for future work (observer logic, cart logic).
